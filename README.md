# 3laws_polymath

## Getting started

### Robot diagnostic module install:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws-public/master/rdm/install.sh) polymath
```

### Robot diagnostic module update:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws-public/master/rdm/update.sh) polymath
```

### Robot diagnostic module uninstall:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws-public/master/rdm/uninstall.sh)
```
## Configuring the diagnostic module
The base configuration file for the diagnostic module can be found at `$HOME/3lawsRoboticsInc/3laws_polymath/config/rdm_config.yaml`.

Feel free to modify that file, but don't forget to **commit and push your changes** so that when we release a new version of the diagnostic module, we also update your config file.

You can specify the name of this config file with the launch arguments `config_filename:="my_awesome_config_name.yaml"`.

If you want to keep your config file offline, you can also put it in `$HOME/3lawsRoboticsInc/config` or `/opt/3lawsRoboticsInc/config`.

If you really don't like these paths or names, you can override the default launch arguments value with `config_search_directories:="['/my/secret/path1','/my/secret/path2']"`.

Finally, the diagnostic module relies on specifying a unique robot identifier for you to distinguish between robots in your dashboard. There are 3 ways to specify this robot identifier, in order of priority:
1. As a launch argument to `rdm.launch.py`: `robot_id:=<ROBOT_ID>`
2. As a field in the config file : `robot_id: <ROBOT_ID>`
3. As an environment variable: `LAWS3_ROBOT_ID=<ROBOT_ID>`

If none of these are specified, the hardware identifier is used instead. The hardware identifier is determined as follow, in order of priority:
1. Value of the `hardware_id` field at the root of the config file
2. Content of `/3laws_robotics/machine-id` file
3. Content of `/etc/machine-id` file
4. Hashed content of `/etc/fstab` file
5. `polymath_robot`

## Running the diagnostic module

### Package
If during the installation process you have chosen the `package` mode, you can just run:
```bash
$HOME/3lawsRoboticsInc/3laws_polymath/packages/start_rdm.sh
```
You can provide launch arguments to the start script as if calling ros2 launch:
```bash
$HOME/3lawsRoboticsInc/3laws_polymath/packages/start_rdm.sh log_level:=<trace|debug|info|warn|err|critical|off> robot_id:=<ROBOT_ID> config_filename:=<CONFIG_FILENAME> config_search_directories:="['<CONFIG_PATH_1>','<CONFIG_PATH_2>']"

If you want to start the diagnostic module as part of your launch system, add the following line to your .bashrc:
```bash
source "$HOME/3lawsRoboticsInc/3laws_polymath/packages/3laws_setup.sh"
```
Source your bashrc : `source ~/.bashrc`, and add the following action to the LaunchDescription in your launch file:
```
from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource
from launch.substitutions import PathJoinSubstitution

IncludeLaunchDescription(
    PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(
        PathJoinSubstitution(
            [
                get_package_share_directory('lll_rdm'),
                'launch',
                'rdm.launch.py',
            ]
        )
    ),
    launch_arguments={
        'log_level': '<trace|debug|info|warn|err|critical|off>',
        'robot_id': '<ROBOT_ID>'
        'config_filename': '<CONFIG_FILENAME>'
        'config_search_directories': "['<CONFIG_PATH_1>','<CONFIG_PATH_2>']"
    }.items(),
)

```

### Docker
The following docker image with the diagnostic module already isntalled is available for you at `ghcr.io/3lawsrobotics/3laws_rdm_polymath:latest`.
This image is updated everytime we release a new version of the software and includes any change you made to your config file and pushed to the repo.

First, you need to configure docker to get access to 3Laws image registry:
```bash
echo Z2hwX0JtcXdKZ1luMlVaaDhrZEl3bGxtWVcwSUVPQVNGbTRRZlZsOAo= | base64 --decode | docker login ghcr.io/3lawsrobotics -u 3lawscustomers --password-stdin
```

You can then run it with:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name 3laws_rdm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -e LAWS3_ROBOT_ID=<ROBOT_ID> --net=host --pid=host -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /etc/machine-id:/3laws_robotics/machine-id ghcr.io/3lawsrobotics/3laws_rdm_polymath:latest
```
or in detached mode with:
```bash
docker run -d --rm --name 3laws_rdm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -e LAWS3_ROBOT_ID=<ROBOT_ID> --net=host --pid=host -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /etc/machine-id:/3laws_robotics/machine-id ghcr.io/3lawsrobotics/3laws_rdm_polymath:latest
```

If you want to use a different config file than the one present in the docker image, you can either rebuild a local docker image yourself (see [Building a the docker container](#Building-a-the-docker-container) section), or bind a folder containing a new config file by adding `-v /my/config/folder:/root/3lawsRoboticsInc/config` to the list of option of `docker run ...`.

You can also add the same launch argument as in package mode at the very end of the `docker run` command. If you add the `bash` argument, this will be open a bash prompt in the docker file for you.


## Building the docker container
To rebuild the docker container, navigate the directory containing this Readme, and run:
```bash
docker build --build-arg BASE_ARCH=<amd64|arm64v8> --rm -f Dockerfile -t <DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME> .
```
